NOTES ABOUT COPYRIGHT:

Not really sure what to put here. do not redistribute. some in the discord asked about copyright so i guess ill put my answwers to those questions and more in in this section

Yes, you can make youtube videos about saturated, actually i kinda implore you to, as the only videos about saturated that i know of are ones that i have made myself. although do keep in mind that saturated is still not finished... actually, im not sure if i will ever "finsh" saturated

yes, you can include saturated in your server. wether it be private, public, or otherwise

yes, you can include saturated in modpacks if you want, wether it be for personal use, private, unlisted, public, or otherwise

yes, you can modify saturated in any way, including backports, as long as it's for personal use... and servrs, i guess. and modpacks, but im not sure how that would work

yes, you can create, like, an addon/expansion to saturated. im... not exactly sure how that would work, but a couple of people have asked if they could in the past, and yeah i guess you can do that idk

no, plz don't ever redistribute saturated publicly. this includes uploading saturated to a modding platform, uploading saturated to your own website, uploading a unoffical version / modded version, uploading a backport of saturated, etc.

there's probably a few others i forgot to mention but ill probably add it in the future
